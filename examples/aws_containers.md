1. **Pod failures**

EKS pods can fail due to issues with the pod definition, node resources, or network connectivity. When a pod fails, EKS will automatically retry the pod up to a maximum of 10 times. If the pod continues to fail, you can use the EKS console or AWS CLI to investigate the issue.

Troubleshooting steps:

* Check the pod definition and ensure that it is correct and up-to-date.
* Verify that the node has sufficient resources (CPU, memory, and disk space).
* Check the pod logs for errors or exceptions.
* Use the EKS console or AWS CLI to retrieve the pod's logs and investigate further.

2. **Deployment failures**

EKS deployments can fail due to issues with the deployment configuration, pod resources, or network connectivity. When a deployment fails, EKS will automatically retry the deployment up to a maximum of 10 times. If the deployment continues to fail, you can use the EKS console or AWS CLI to investigate the issue.

Troubleshooting steps:

* Check the deployment configuration and ensure that it is correct and up-to-date.
* Verify that the node has sufficient resources (CPU, memory, and disk space).
* Check the pod logs for errors or exceptions.
* Use the EKS console or AWS CLI to retrieve the deployment's logs and investigate further.

3. **Node issues**

EKS nodes can experience issues due to hardware failures, software bugs, or resource constraints. When a node fails, EKS will automatically replace it with a new node. If the issue persists, you can use the EKS console or AWS CLI to investigate the issue.

Troubleshooting steps:

* Check the node's system logs for errors or exceptions.
* Verify that the node has sufficient resources (CPU, memory, and disk space).
* Check the pod logs for errors or exceptions.
* Use the EKS console or AWS CLI to retrieve the node's system logs and investigate further.

**Debugging**

Debugging is an essential step in troubleshooting and resolving issues in ECS and EKS. Here are some strategies for debugging:

1. **Use the ECS console or EKS console**
